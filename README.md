This app is built for recognising faces from pictures by using clarifai API (https://www.clarifai.com/). 

Once an image url is in the search bar, for example: https://www.ldatschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/A-teachers-journey-with-student-self-advocacy.jpg. The face area will be detected by clicking 'detect' button.
